# Web Text Editor

## Description

My motivation for creating this web text editor was to address the need for a simple, efficient, and user-friendly tool for editing text within a web browser. I wanted to develop a solution that not only allowed users to seamlessly edit text but also ensured that their work was automatically saved when the browser window lost focus. I built this project to provide users with a convenient and accessible text editing tool that could be used directly within their web browsers. The primary goal was to eliminate the need for users to install separate text editing software, streamlining the editing process and enhancing productivity.

This web text editor solves the problem of quick and hassle-free text editing without the need for complex desktop applications. Users can access and use the editor directly from their browsers, and their work is automatically saved, preventing any loss of data due to browser tab closures or accidental navigation away from the page. Through the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in web application development and the implementation of progressive web application (PWA) features. Additionally, I learned the essentials of PWA installation, making web applications more accessible and versatile for users. 


## Installation

This application is installable as a progressive web app. You can click the install button in the address bar in Google Chrome to use the editor when offline, or just launch from your desktop.

## Usage

This editor is very simple to use. Enter any text and when the window loses focus your work will automatically be saved locally for offline use.
